/*  This file will contain functions that allow for checking if two objects are colliding
 *  The prefered format for doing this would be
 *      collide(object1 , object 2)
 *  which would then return true of false wether or not object one and object two overlap
 *  However, as development progresses, we may need to add more functions and increase complexity.
